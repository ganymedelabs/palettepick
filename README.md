PalettePick is a Chrome extension that enhances your browsing experience by detecting and highlighting color strings directly on web pages. Whether it's CSS color names, hex codes, RGB, RGBA, HSL, or HSLA, the extension highlights these colors with their actual hues.  

You can also interact with these highlighted colors to transform them into different formats. Additionally, the extension includes a built-in color picker that allows you to select and save colors from any webpage and even generates palettes based on your selected colors.
